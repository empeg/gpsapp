* Investigate why buttons seem to be 'ghosted' through to the player.
  Perhaps it is a result of using HIJACK_POLLBUTTONS instead of
  WAITBUTTONS?

* Display current speed/averaged speed/magnetic north/GPS time.
  Probably not really enough room on the display for too much more
  information. We could speed/ETE/altitude instead of the fancy arrow.

* NMEA output over IRDA (and in the satellite screen).

* Initial position in config.ini, Zodiac support.

* Rotate map so that the top is in the direction we're driving. Have to
  transform all coordinates, maybe too CPU intensive? Also we have fewer
  pixels in that direction.

* Use the bearing pointer as a compass when no route is loaded.
  (Need a way to discard the current route then...)

* Make menu code a bit more structured and the final menus nicer on
  the eye.

* Cleanup python scripts.

* Tiger/Line dataset to street map conversion.

* Actually try to do on-the-fly routing based on the Tiger/Line mapdata.
  Although they don't contain one-way street information, however if we
  can reroute dynamically that should only be a minor problem.

* Support for more GPS protocols (Oncore/Magellan/Lowrance?)

* Sync the empeg clock based on GPS time. We need to estimate the
  additional delays introduced by serial and gpsapp.
