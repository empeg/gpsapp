* Satellite strength display.

* Display current speed/averaged speed/magnetic north/GPS time.
  Probably not really enough room on the display for too much more
  information. New screen?

* NMEA output over IRDA.

* Rotate map so that the top is in the direction we're driving. Have to
  transform all coordinates, maybe too CPU intensive? Also we have fewer
  pixels in that direction.

* Use the bearing pointer as a compass when no route is loaded.
  (Need a way to discard the current route then...)

* Make menu code a bit more structured and the final menus nicer on
  the eye.

* Cleanup python scripts.

* Tiger/Line dataset to street map conversion.

* Actually try to do on-the-fly routing based on the Tiger/Line mapdata.
  Although they don't contain one-way street information, however if we
  can reroute dynamically that should only be a minor problem.

* More GPS protocol support (Earthmate/Tripmate/Oncore/Magellan/Lowrance?)

* Derive the local timezone offset and daylight savings time from the
  GPS data in some way.

* Sync the empeg clock based on GPS time. We need to be able to derive
  localtime first, and have some estimate of the additional delays
  introduced by serial and gpsapp.
