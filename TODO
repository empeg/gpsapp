* The current method for figuring where we are in a route often
  incorrectly picks the wrong waypoint.

* Display current speed/averaged speed/magnetic north/GPS time.
  Probably not really enough room on the display for too much more
  information.

* Use the bearing pointer as a compass when no route is loaded.
  (Need a way to discard the current route then...)

* Make menu code a bit more structured and the final menus nicer on
  the eye.

* Cleanup python scripts.

* Automatically generate the 'Continue onto, bear left/right,
  left/right, sharp left/right based on the direction in which we
  approach and leave a waypoint. This allows us to simplify the
  descriptions and to correct them when we're approaching a route
  from a different direction.

* Tiger/Line dataset to street level map conversion.

* Other than NMEA gps interfacing code (Earthmate/Tripmate/Trimble/Oncore/
  Garmin/Magellan/gpsd?).

* Can we derive the local timezone offset from the GPS data in some way?

* Actually try to do on-the-fly routing based on the Tiger/Line mapdata.
  Although they don't contain one-way street information, however if we
  can reroute dynamically that should only be a minor problem.
