Changes in v0.4

* Popup messages didn't automatically continue popping up if it weren't for
  other events that triggered a screen refresh.
* Changed speed calculation, now we're averaging the actual speed towards the
  next point on the route and use a smaller averaging factor.
* Was testing for overflow in vfdlib_drawLine in the wrong place, large
  negative numbers would still slip through.
* Removed static buffers in formatdist and time_estimate.
* Changed serial handling a bit, we pass character instead of line at a time
  to the protocol specific handler. This made it easier to add other protocols.
* Added code to handle Garmin and Trimble TSIP/TAIP protocols, but only
  Garmin has been tested. You can start gpsapp [nmea|garmin|tsip|taip] to
  select any specific protocol.


Changes in v0.3

* There was a clipping problem in vfdlib_drawLine where it was writing bits
  outside of the display area. The fix I had implemented was very hardhanded
  by simply checking every single pixel. Figured out where the integer
  overflow occured and replaced the hack with a far cleaner (and somewhat
  faster) solution that simply avoids drawing the lines that cause the
  overflow.
* Doing a weighted average over the approximate past 2-4 minutes of speed
  measurements (depending on GPS reporting rate). The previous way of using
  the gps speed estimate directly made ETA/ETE calculations mostly unusable.
