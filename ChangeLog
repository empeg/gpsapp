Changes in v0.3

* There was a clipping problem in vfdlib_drawLine where it was writing bits
  outside of the display area. The fix I had implemented was very hardhanded
  by simply checking every single pixel. Figured out where the integer
  overflow occured and replaced the hack with a far cleaner (and somewhat
  faster) solution that simply avoids drawing the lines that cause the
  overflow.
* Doing a weighted average over the approximate past 2-4 minutes of speed
  measurements (depending on GPS reporting rate). The previous way of using
  the gps speed estimate directly made ETA/ETE calculations mostly unusable.
